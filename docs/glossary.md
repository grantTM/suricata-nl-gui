# Glossary of Terms

This glossary defines key terms used throughout the SME IDS tool and the Suricata ruleset while helping non-technical users or small business IT staff get up to speed quickly.

---

### Alert
A notification generated by Suricata when traffic matches a detection rule. Alerts can be indicative of suspicious, unauthorized, or malicious activity.

---

### SSH (Secure Shell)
A network protocol used to securely log into remote server, frequently used in brute force attacks to attempt many different password combinations.

---

### Brute Force Attack
A method of trying many passwords or login attempts in rapid succession to gain unauthorized access to a system. This is often aided by scripting and massive libraries of commonly used or exposed passwords from prior breaches.

---

### DNS (Domain Name System)
A system that translates domain names (like `example.com`) into IP addresses. Monitoring DNS queries can reveal attempts to connect to suspicious or malicious domains.

---

### Firewall
A security system that controls network traffic based on predetermined rules. Your IDS complements this by detecting threats that may pass through the firewall.

---

### Flowbit
A special rule keyword in Suricata used to track state across multiple pakcets or sessions. It allows chaining of Suricata rules by setting a flag on one rule that allows it to be validated by another. This is useful for instances like multi-stage attacks as in brute force attempts that push multiple SSH attempts in rapid succession.

---

### Threshold
A rule condition that limits when alerts trigger based on frequency (e.g., "alert if 5+ attempts have been made in 30 seconds"). Useful for noise reduction and false positives.

---

### Rule
A detection pattern written in Suricata's syntax that defines what traffic to watch for and when to trigger alerts.

---

### SID (Signature ID)
A unique number assigned to each Suricata rule. Required for the rule engine to identify and track each rule.

---

### PCAP (Packet Capture)
A file format that stores network traffic. It can be used for offline analysis or to replay traffic for testing IDS rules and their corresponding alerts.

---

### Eve.json
The main JSON log file where Suricata writes alerts and other events. The GUI translates these alerts into a more human-readable format and displays alerts from this file.

---

### Docker
Not your favorite dress pant, but a tool that packages software into self-contained environments, making it easy to run the app on any system (Windows, macOS, Linux) without setup headaches.
